I am writing to apply for the Visiting Assistant Professor position in Mathematics at Franklin \& Marshall College. I received my Ph.D.\ from Arizona State University in May of 2013 after working with Prof.\ Hal Kierstead. 
My general areas of research interest include structural and extremal graph theory, algorithmic group theory and philosophical logic.  
In particular, I am drawn to problems at intersections of computer science, math and philosophy.  
Interdisciplinarity is a natural extension of my experience in industry and my academic and pedagogical collaborations with artists and philosophers.  

My graduate work focused on graph coloring and partitioning.  
One of my favorite results from this work is a simultaneous generalization of Hall's marriage theorem and Vizing's edge coloring theorem in terms of winning strategies in a certain two-player game.  
In philosophy, I made progress on determining which relations of reference afford the structure necessary to support the infinite semantic paradoxes.  
My research appears in numerous journals including \textit{Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B}, \emph{Discrete Mathematics}, \textit{Analysis}, \textit{Journal of Philosophical Logic} and \textit{Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra}.

I am able to teach courses in calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, abstract algebra, analysis, topology and anything in discrete math or computer science.  
I would look forward to bringing my experience to a community that values rigorous scholarship and collaboration with undergraduate students.

Enclosed are my curriculum vitae, research statement, teaching statement and transcripts.  
All of my publications and presentations are available at:

Please let me know if there are any other materials or information that will assist you in processing my application.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.
