\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{QQ}
A farmer has 3000 bananas. She needs to take them to the market 1000 miles away to sell them;
however, she only has the strength to carry 1000 bananas at a time. Also, she needs to eat 1 banana
to have the energy to travel 1 mile. What is the maximum number of bananas she can get to the
market?
\end{QQ}

Let $M$ be the maximum number of bananas she can get to the market.

\begin{QQ}
How do you know your answer in Question 1 equals $M$? Can you prove it?
\end{QQ}

\begin{QQ}
Can she get $M$ bananas to the market without leaving any bananas behind on her path?
\end{QQ}

\begin{QQ}
Can she get $M$ bananas to the market and also leave bananas behind on her path?
\end{QQ}

\begin{QQ}
What is the minimum number of bananas she can eat while still getting $M$ bananas to the market?
\end{QQ}

\begin{QQ}
What is the maximum number of bananas she can eat while still getting $M$ bananas to the market?
\end{QQ}

\begin{QQ}
What if her sister, who can also carry 1000 bananas but also has to eat 1 banana
to have the energy to travel 1 mile helps her?  Can they get more bananas to the market?  If so, how many?
\end{QQ}
