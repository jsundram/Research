\maketitle
Trying to synthesize all the new incoming ideas overwhelms sometimes, feels like there is this machine i can lift my brain up into and see all the things
at the same time. but hard to stay there, but i think that is fine, in and out, knowing what it is and that it is not bad give me control. i was thinking
of people's use of the phrase 'psychotic break'.  i think i see what that is now, it is breaking through, seeing and getting scared.  but meditation appears
to be able to meta the fear.  then it is just seeing farther, meta the fear which may itself be scary and meta that and so on.  write when i feel
like writing, this log instead of just typing it to Bobby.
