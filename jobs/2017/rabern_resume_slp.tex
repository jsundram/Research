\begin{quote}
This article is about coloring countries on a map so that adjacent countries receive distinct colors.  It was conjectured
in 1852 that any map could be colored thusly using only 4 colors.  This was finally proved in 1976, but the proof is not human-checkable;
it requires many hours of computer time to check thousands of cases.  Finding a human-checkable proof is still an open problem.
To prove that 5 colors suffice is relatively simple.  We gave a human-checkable proof that 4.5 colors suffice; this means that
we get to use 9 colors, but have to assign each country 2 colors.

\begin{quote}
Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. 
True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. 
Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. 
The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for yes and no are da and ja, in some order. 
You do not know which word means which.
	  \squishlist
		\item showed how to trivialize the puzzle by asking questions that elicit meaningful answers from Random
		\item showed how to solve the puzzle in only two questions by using paradoxes to explode god-heads
		\item this article led to the problem getting a lot of press and many follow-up papers have been written (17 so far)
